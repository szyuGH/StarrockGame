Damage Calculations:

- Weapons will be destroyed on Contact (except laser beam)
- Asteroids will be destroyed on Contact
- Ship
	- Asteroid
		Damage will be calculated based on both bodies' velocities and masses
		
	- Ship
		Damage will be calculated based on both bodies' velocities and masses
		
	- Weapon
		Shield will only be damaged by laser weapons
		Structure will be damaged by lasers, when shield is 0
		Structure will be damaged by all other weapons
		Damage is based on the weapons damage
		
	- Border
		Damage will be calculated based on the ships velocity in relation to the normale of the border and the ship's mass

(For next iteration)
- Border doesnt stop an entity but decelerates it or puts a force back to the center.
- Rockets, Missiles and Mines explode, damaging everything in explosion range.
